# share-dinner
Calculates how much each person should pay for their share from each dinner dish

## Problem
Let's say you and your colleagues go to a restaurant and instead of everyone getting their own dish, everyone together picks a few dishes and samples everything. Some people liked one dish more and another dish left, so everyone has unequal amounts of everything. This sounds nice in theory, but becomes a nightmare once everyone tries to figure out who had how much of each item, and how much they should pay.

## Solution
1. Program a calculator to determine the value of each potion
2. Determine the price everyone should pay for their portions
3. Sum up all portion values per person to determine how much they should pay.
4. Confirm that the normal total value equals the sum of portion values.

## Progress
Develop a calculator  to accomplish this...
1. Excel: COMPLETE, see repository
2. R: In progress, would like help
3. Shiny, so the calculator can function as a standalone app
